# ID2223 - Scaleable Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Introduction
This course marries data parallel programming with deep learning, and helps students to work on distributed deep learning problems with big datasets. At the end of the course students will be familiar with and knowing how to implement the main machine learning and deep learning algorithms using data parallel programming platforms, such as Spark and TensorFlow, on a cluster of computers and apply them on massive datasets.

## Lab 1
In this lab assignment you will practice the basics of regression and classification in Spark. The given notebook is in Scala, but feel free to use Python if you prefer.

## Lab 2
To be added.
