## Introduction
This course marries data parallel programming with deep learning, and helps students to work on distributed deep learning problems with big datasets. At the end of the course students will be familiar with and knowing how to implement the main machine learning and deep learning algorithms using data parallel programming platforms, such as Spark and TensorFlow, on a cluster of computers and apply them on massive datasets.

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for lab 1 and lab 2, and our answers to the review questions 1 to 5 in pdf format.

## Lab 1 - SparkML
In this lab assignment, we practice the basics of data wrangling, regression, and classification in Spark.

## Lab 2 - TensorFlow
To be added.
